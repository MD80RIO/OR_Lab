# An application of OR theory. 

During the last year of my BSc in Management Engineering, I have been partecipating in an Operations Research laboratory which aimed to enable the students to use Python's Pyomo library to elaborate and solve a real world Operations-Research problem. 

In one particular occasion, I have received from my teacher, Operations Research Doctor of Philosophy Ruggiero Seccia, the task to organize the optimal strategy for a company producing a various set of five different products. I have elaborated the model using pyomo modelling style and solved with the recommended solver, glpk. 

The project has been realized in jupyter notebook. As a La Sapienza Management Engineer I have developed a strong background in Optimization Theory, both continous and discrete. I am currently studying to expand my knowledge of this wonderful subject in my Master of Science.
